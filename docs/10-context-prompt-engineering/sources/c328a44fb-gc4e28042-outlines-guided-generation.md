1 Introduction
We are concerned with the problem of generating sequences of tokens from
a large language model (LLM) [Vaswani et al., 2017, Radford et al., 2019]
that conform to regular expressions or context-free grammars (CFGs). This
kind of guided LLM generation is used to make LLM model output usable

Poesiaetal.,2022b,Gengetal.,2023,Wangetal.,2023]. Suchfeatureshave
recently been generalized in prompting libraries and interfaces [Microsoft,

2023, Beurer-Kellner et al., 2023, Rickard, 2023a,b], but their applicability
can be limited by their scaling costs.
Most implementations of guided generation bias the score values used
to determine the probabilities of the tokens in an LLM’s vocabulary. A
commonandsufficientapproachinvolvesrepeatedevaluationsovertheentire
vocabulary in order to determine which tokens are valid–according to the
constraints and previously sampled tokens–and setting the probabilities of
invalid tokens to zero. This approach entails a fixed O(N) cost for each
token generated, where N is the size of the LLM’s vocabulary.
We propose an approach that uses the finite state machine (FSM) for-
mulation of regular expressions to both arbitrarily start and stop guided
generation and allow the construction of an index with which the set of non-
zero-probability tokens can be obtained efficiently at each step. The result
is an algorithm that costs O(1) on average.
For the regular expression case, our approach shares the most similarity
with Kuchnik et al. [2023], which uses a transducer formulation to obtain
FSMs defined over a language model’s vocabulary, and these FSMs contain
much of the same information and scaling benefits as the indices described
here. Our approach does not require the complete transducer abstraction
and can be used to more easily extend existing, efficient regular expression
libraries without modifying the underlying automatons and their implemen-
tations.
More importantly, our indexing approach can also be extended to CFGs
and LALR(1) parsers to allow for efficient guided generation according to
popular data formats and programming languages (e.g. JSON, Python,
SQL, etc.). The transition to parsing is made by way of augmentations to
traditionalLALR(1)parsercomponentsandoperations,makingit–again–an
approach that can be used to extend existing parser implementations.
2 LLM Sampling and Guided Generation
Let S = (s ...s ) represent a sequence of t tokens with s ∈ V, V a vocab-
t 1 t t
ulary, and |V| = N. The vocabularies, V, are composed of strings from a
fixed alphabet [Sennrich et al., 2015] and N is often on the order of 104 or
larger.
We define the next token s as the following random variable:
t+1
α = LLM(S ,θ)
t
s ∼ Categorical(α)
t+1

of this paper the function LLM refers to a deep neural network trained on
next-token-completion tasks, but the method extends more generally to any
function that takes token sequences and returns a probability distribution

| 2.1 Sampling | sequences |     |     |     |
Let F ⊂ P(V), where P is the powerset operator, be subsets of multi-token
strings that end with a special token EOS ∈ V. The text generation task is
| to draw | samples from | F.  |     |     |
| ------- | ------------ | --- | --- | --- |
Several procedures have been considered to generate elements of F.
Greedy decoding consists in generating tokens recursively, choosing the to-
kenwithhighestprobabilityateachstep. Beamsearchalsogeneratestokens
recursively, using a heuristic to find the mode of the distribution. More re-
cently, SMC sampling has also been used to generate sequences [Lew et al.,
2023].

The sampling procedure with masking is a simple augmentation of Al-
| gorithm | 1 and | is provided | in Algorithm | 2.  |     |     |     |
| ------- | ----- | ----------- | ------------ | --- | --- | --- | --- |
The computation of m on line 2.5 is implicitly performed over all the
elements of V. Aside from computing α, this step is easily the most ex-
pensive. In the case of regular expression-guided masking–and cases more
sophisticated than that–the support and, thus, m will necessarily depend on
the previously sampled tokens. Guided generation of this kind is ultimately
an iterative matching or parsing problem and is not directly amenable to
standard approaches that require access to a complete string upfront. In
some cases, partial matching or parsing can be performed from the start
of the sampled sequence on each iteration, but this has a cost that grows
at least linearly alongside the O(N) cost of its application across the entire
vocabulary.
This leads us to the main questions of this work: how can we efficiently
match or parse incomplete strings according to a regular expression or CFG
| and determine |     | the masks | m at each | iteration | of Algorithm | 2?  |     |

We frame the case of regular expression guided generation in terms of state
machines. This framing allows us to specify exactly how regular expression
matching can be arbitrarily started and stopped, so that it can be easily
and efficiently continued between samples of s˜ , as well as how the masks
i+1
| can be | computed | without | run-time | evaluations |     | over V. |

Definition 1 (Finite Automaton). A finite automaton, or finite-state ma-

Example 1. We illustrate the FSM sampling process in Figure 1 for the reg-
ularexpression([0-9]*)?\.?[0-9]*, whichcanbeusedtogeneratefloating-
point numbers. For simplicity, let the vocabulary, V, consist of only the
| strings: | "A", ".", "42", | ".2", | and "1". |     |     |     |
| -------- | --------------- | ----- | -------- | --- | --- | --- |
When the generation begins, the FSM is in state 0, so our algorithm
masks the string "A", since it would not be accepted by the FSM. We can
| only sample | ".", "42", | ".2", and | "1" in this | case. |     |     |
| ----------- | ---------- | --------- | ----------- | ----- | --- | --- |
If we sample ".2", we advance the FSM to state 3. In this case, only
"42" and "1" are valid completions, so we mask the other values before
sampling. If we sample "1" instead, we advance the FSM to state 1, in
which case ".", ".42", ".2", and are valid completions and the mask
"1"
| remains | unchanged. |     |     |     |     |     |

Looping through the vocabulary to determine the valid next tokens is
still the biggest issue. For that, we pre-process the vocabulary using the
regular expression’s FSM and build an index. The important part is that
we consider starting in every viable FSM state, because the strings in the
vocabulary could match arbitrary parts of a regular expression, and those
| parts are | implicitly | the FSM states. |     |     |     |     |

A procedure for producing matches starting at any point in the FSM
is given in Algorithm 3. The result is a list of sub-sequences detailing the
states through which the FSM would traverses when accepting the provided
string.

By matching the starting states of these sub-sequences to the last FSM
state arrived at in a single step of the loop in Algorithm 2, we can efficiently
index the vocabulary with a map, σ : Q → P(V), connecting FSM states
and sets of elements of the vocabulary that will be accepted by the FSM in
those states.

| --------- | ----------- | --- | ------------ | --- | ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Using a hash-map for σ can make the m step in Algorithm 2 cost only
O(1) on average. Furthermore, since σ is constructed outside of the token
sampling procedure, its run-time cost is effectively irrelevant, although it
theoreticallyrequiresmemoryequaltothenumberofstatesintheFSM(i.e.
|Q|). Fortunately, for non-pathological combinations of regular expressions
and vocabularies, not every string in the vocabulary will be accepted by the
| FSM, and | not every | FSM | state will | be represented | by  | a string | in  | V.  |     |

To illustrate the efficiency of the indexing approach described here, and
implemented in Outlines, we perform a simple comparison with the Guid-
ance library. As of this writing, the Guidance library uses partial regular
expression matching–applied from the start of the sampled sequence each
time–and must iterate over the LLM’s vocabulary (N = 50,257) on each
step.
The Guidance code and prompt used for this comparison are as follows:

The value of max_tokens is varied and the timings are recorded with
timeit for a single loop and single repeat value (i.e. only one sample is col-
lected for each value of max_tokens). The results are plotted in Section 3.2.
Barring any configuration oversights that might be creating a large run-
time discrepancy, the observed scaling in the maximum number of sampled
tokens is striking and is indicative of the growing computational problem
implied by the approach.

4 Extensions to Iterative Parsing
In this section, we move our focus to general parser-guided generation and
start with a simple walk-through for a Python-like grammar provided as a
CFG.
12

Consider a vocabulary consisting of strings like "d" and "ef" that can
be combined to produce Python-like syntax according to an implicit CFG,
and assume that these strings are sequentially sampled and concatenated
according to a process like Algorithm 1.
Furthermore, consider a terminal symbol DEF in the CFG that corre-
spondstothestring"def"andisgivenbythetrivialregularexpressiondef.
Also, consider a NAME symbol given by the regular expression [^\W\d]\w*
(e.g. Python identifiers). We want to sequentially parse strings sampled
from the aforementioned vocabulary in a way that adheres the Python syn-
tax.
For example, the following could be one such sequence: ["d", "ef", "
f", "oo(", "):", " ", "pass"]. All the elements of the sequence are by
definition elements of the vocabulary. Concatenating the sequence produces
"def foo(): pass", whichisavalidsequenceoftokensdefiningafunction.
In the situation we’re considering, we will have observed all the tokens up
to a certain point and know nothing about the ones after that point.
For instance, at the third observation in the example sequence, we have
the concatenated string "def f". If we were to lex/parse this string a tradi-
tionalapproachwouldreturnthesymbolsequenceDEF NAME,whichmisiden-
tifies the "f" as a complete NAME token. As we can see from the rest of the
sequence, the correct NAME token will be "foo".
In general, the next valid strings that can be sampled from the vocabu-
lary are ones that either
1. continue expanding/advancing the NAME currently starting with "f"
(as the full sequence in our example does), and/or
2. anything that begins with "("–i.e. an LPAR symbol with regular ex-
pression (–and proceeds to specify a valid argument signature.
In the first case, the "f" can be seen as a partially matched NAME symbol
in Python, and–recalling that its regular expression is [^\W\d]\w*–we can
say that it matches both sub-patterns (i.e. [^\W\d] and \w*) in the regular
expression. Our use of FSMs formalize the notion of sub-patterns by way
of an FSM’s states. In this case, the regex for NAME can be represented by
an FSM, M, with three states: 0 (i.e. the initial state q ), 1 (i.e. [^\W\d]),
0
and 2 (i.e. \w*), where 1,2 ∈ F.
Using Algorithm 3, we would obtain the FSM state sequences (0,1),
(1,2), (2,2) for "f" and the FSM, M, corresponding to the NAME symbol.
These FSM sequences for "f" tell us that matching can start for this vocab-
ulary string in the states 0, 1, or 2, and it can end in states 1 or 2.
13

According to case 1. above, parsing can be continued–for the NAME
symbol–after previously ending in states 1 or 2. According to case 2., the
next string could also start with or contain an LPAR, implying that M would
have terminated, which it can given that 1 and 2 are final states in M at
which the parsing would have stopped after reading "f". M terminating
also indicates that a NAME symbol was completed, and that a transition to
a state accepting LPAR was allowed by the grammar.
In this illustration, the next valid vocabulary strings are at least "d",
"ef", "pass", " ", "oo(", because all of those strings would expand the
partially matched NAME, and the last one would also progress the parse state
to one that reads an LPAR. The remaining string, "):", from the subset
of the vocabulary we’ve considered would result in a sequence with invalid
syntax.
In relation to the FSM indexing approach, this means that Algorithm 4
would map FSM states 0, 1, and 2 to the subset "d", "ef", "pass", "
", "oo(" for the symbol NAME and its FSM, M.
Thisillustrationomitstheunderlyingparserstatesthatdeterminewhich
grammar symbols and transitions are allowed. We use pushdown automata
(PDA) as a means to extend the FSM approach and address the remaining
details.
4.1 Pushdown Automata Formulation
We define pushdown automata using the following 6-tuple representation
[Sipser, 1996, Definition 2.13]:
Definition 2 (Pushdown Automaton). A pushdown automaton is given by
(Q,Σ,Γ,δ,q ,F), where Q, Σ, Γ, and F are all finite sets, Γ is the stack
0
alphabet, δ : Q×Σ ×Γ → P(Q×Γ ), Γ ≡ Γ∪ϵ, ϵ is the empty character,
ϵ ϵ ϵ ϵ
and the remaining symbols retain their meanings from the finite automaton
definition.
In order to construct an indexing approach for a PDA-driven parser, we
need to use the connection between a CFG’s symbols–via a corresponding
PDA’salphabet–andthelexingandscanningstepsthatproducethesymbols
read by a PDA.
Morespecifically,parsersaresupportedbylexersandscannersthatiden-
tify symbols from a sequence of character inputs, as we implicitly illustrated
in Section 4. Ordered lists of terminal symbols can be constructed for each
parse/PDA state based on the symbol and stack transitions allowed by the
map δ in each state. This means that we can construct an FSM for each
14

parse state that is the union of each FSM corresponding to a terminal sym-
bols read by the state.
A scanning step will then identify a set of possible terminal symbols
V ⊂ Σ for the characters read since the last fully identified symbol in the
parsingprocess. Forexample,intheinitialstateq ofaPDAforthePython-
0
like CFG in Section 4, scanning and lexing the string "de" will result in
V = {DEF,NAME}: i.e. DEF for any vocabulary string completing the string
"def"–followed by a string not also read by the NAME FSM (e.g. "def ")–
and NAME for any other strings read by its FSM (e.g. "default"). Note that
steps of the scanner–and sampling steps of the LLM–will eventually reduce
the set V until a single terminal symbol v ∈ V is determined.
By applying Algorithm 3 to each string in V using the combined FSMs
for each parse state, we can determine parser configurations that consist of
the PDA states, the corresponding FSM states, and the potential terminal
symbols.
By analogy with the steps in Algorithm 3, we can use the pre-image of
the PDA’s transition map to determine PDA stack values that will read the
PDA states q ∈ Q and terminal symbol sets V of a parser configuration:
δ−1(q,V,·) ≡ {g : δ(q,v,g) ∈ P(Q×Γ ),g ∈ Γ ,v ∈ V}.

in V starting from their possible parser configurations. For parser state and
terminal combinations that correspond to REDUCE operations of an LALR(1)
parser, these parser configurations will consist of more than just the top-
of-stack values in Γ; they will consist of sub-stacks corresponding to all
valid prefixes for the REDUCE operations entailed by a vocabulary string.
Ultimately, each parser configuration that permits a complete parse of a
vocabulary string is added as an entry in the index for the PDA, and, in
this case, the index will need to be a trie data structure in order to allow
queries against the parser’s stack values.
5 Discussion
The vocabulary indexing introduced in this paper removes a prohibitive
run-time scaling barrier in guided generation. Naturally, it makes a trade-
off between processing and memory, but we believe that the memory costs
are relatively low on average and–when not–can be reduced through con-
ventional means.
15

In our tests using a slightly augmented version of the Python grammar,
we find that even naively constructed indices (i.e. ones containing unused
and redundant parser and FSM state configurations) are still only around
50 MB. Furthermore, these indices were constructed with un-reduced DFAs,
implying that there are numerous redundant states unnecessarily increasing
the size of the indices. Likewise, if the exact representation of the state
machinesiseveranissue, it’spossiblethatotherstatemachineformulations
with lower memory requirements could suffice (e.g. NFAs).
The implications of this work are not limited to neural text generation.
For instance, one could use the indexing approach described here to assist
with the training or fine-tuning of LLMs when structured outputs are re-
quired. We can also speculate that assisted generation during training may
reduce the need for a model to learn syntactic details.
In addition, this method provides an alternative way to evaluate cur-
rent models. One could, for instance, attempt to quantify the discrepancy
between the masked logits generated by our method and the raw logits gen-
erated by the model. Which could in turn inform the training objective of
a model.
It may also be possible to “lift” the masks computed by this approach
into the language models themselves. Basically, the masks implicitly de-
termine which computations do not need to be performed. Our current
formulation only applies the masks at the lowest level, but, by lifting the
masksfurtherupintothearchitectureofthemodel, wemaybeabletomod-
ulate which slices of the model parameters are needed before unnecessarily
performing operations on them. This has the potential to further reduce
computational costs.
