1 Introduction
There has been a proliferation of LLM-based chat assistants (chatbots) that leverage supervised
instruction fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to unlock new
instruction following and conversational abilities [31, 2, 30, 8, 52, 48, 14]. Once aligned with
humans,thesechatmodelsarestronglypreferredbyhumanusersovertheoriginal,unalignedmodels
onwhichtheyarebuilt. However,theheighteneduserpreferencedoesnotalwayscorrespondto
improvedscoresontraditionalLLMbenchmarks–benchmarkslikeMMLU[19]andHELM[24]
cannot effectively tell the difference between these aligned models and the base models. This
phenomenon suggests that there is a fundamental discrepancy between user perceptions of the
usefulnessofchatbotsandthecriteriaadoptedbyconventionalbenchmarks.
WearguethatthisdiscrepancyprimarilyarisesduetoexistingevaluationthatonlymeasuresLLMs’
core capability on a confined set of tasks (e.g., multi-choice knowledge or retrieval questions),

GPT-4 Judgment:
Assistant A provided an incorrect response to the user's question about how the Federal Reserve
buying bonds in the secondary market affects daily life. The answer given is repetitive and lacks
clear examples of how the action impacts daily life.
On the other hand, Assistant B provided a relevant and accurate response to the user's question about
the Federal Reserve buying bonds. The answer includes three clear examples of how the action impacts
daily life, such as interest rates, inflation, and employment.
Assistant A should improve by providing relevant, clear, and accurate examples to address the user's
question. Assistant B's response is more helpful, relevant, and detailed.

2.1 Motivation
WiththerecentadvancesofLLMs,LLM-basedassistantsstarttoexhibitartificialgeneralintelligence
acrossdiversetasks,fromwritingandchattingtocoding[5,30,1,37]. However,evaluatingtheir
broadcapabilitiesalsobecomesmorechallenging. Despitetheavailabilityofnumerousbenchmarks
forlanguagemodels,theyprimarilyfocusonevaluatingmodelsonclosed-endedquestionswithshort
responses. Giventhatthesechatassistantscannowpreciselyfollowuserinstructionsinmulti-turn
dialoguesandansweropen-endedquestionsinazero-shotmanner,currentbenchmarksareinadequate
forassessingsuchcapabilities. Existingbenchmarksmostlyfallintothefollowingthreecategories.
• Core-knowledge benchmarks, including MMLU [19], HellaSwag [50], ARC [9], Wino-
Grande[36],HumanEval[6],GSM-8K[10],andAGIEval[51],evaluatethecorecapabilitiesof
pre-trainedLLMsusingzero-shotandfew-shotbenchmarksets. TheytypicallyrequireLLMsto

• Instruction-followingbenchmarks,suchasFlan[27,46],Self-instruct[44],NaturalInstruc-
tions[28],Super-NaturalInstructions[45],expandtoslightlymoreopen-endedquestionsand
morediversetasksandareusedtoevaluateLLMsafterinstructionfine-tuning.
• Conversationalbenchmarks, likeCoQA[35], MMDialog[15]andOpenAssistant[23], are
closesttoourintendedusecases. However,thediversityandcomplexityoftheirquestionsoften
fallshortinchallengingthecapabilitiesofthelatestchatbots.
WhilelargelyoverlookedbyexistingLLMbenchmarks,humanpreferencesserveasadirectmeasure
of a chatbot’s utility in open-ended, multi-turn human-AI interactions. To bridge this gap, we

WhileourinitialevaluationsusingMT-benchandChatbotArenarelyonhumanratings,collecting
human preferences can be costly and laborious [44, 38, 31, 2, 13]. To overcome this, we aim to
developamorescalableandautomatedapproach.GiventhatmostquestionsinMT-benchandChatbot

3.1 TypesofLLM-as-a-Judge
Wepropose3LLM-as-a-judgevariations. Theycanbeimplementedindependentlyorincombination:
• Pairwisecomparison. AnLLMjudgeispresentedwithaquestionandtwoanswers,andtasked
todeterminewhichoneisbetterordeclareatie. ThepromptusedisgiveninFigure5(Appendix).
• Singleanswergrading. Alternatively, anLLMjudgeisaskedtodirectlyassignascoretoa
singleanswer. ThepromptusedforthisscenarioisinFigure6(Appendix).
• Reference-guidedgrading. Incertaincases,itmaybebeneficialtoprovideareferencesolution
ifapplicable. AnexamplepromptweuseforgradingmathproblemsisinFigure8(Appendix).
These methods have different pros and cons. For example, the pairwise comparison may lack
scalability when the number of players increases, given that the number of possible pairs grows
quadratically;singleanswergradingmaybeunabletodiscernsubtledifferencesbetweenspecific
pairs,anditsresultsmaybecomeunstable,asabsolutescoresarelikelytofluctuatemorethanrelative

GPT-4 Judgment (when A is placed in the first position):
Both Assistant A and Assistant B provide helpful and relevant information about business etiquette
norms in Japan. However, Assistant A’s answer is more detailed and organized, covering a wider range
of topics such as dress code and language, which are not mentioned in Assistant B’s response.
Assistant A also provides more specific advice on how to handle certain situations, such as
exchanging business cards and dining etiquette. Therefore, Assistant A’s answer is more comprehensive
and useful for someone looking to understand Japanese business etiquette.
GPT-4 Judgment (when B is placed in the first position):
Both Assistant A and Assistant B provide helpful and relevant information about business etiquette
norms in Japan. However, Assistant B’s answer is more detailed and covers a wider range of topics,
such as addressing people by their titles, avoiding direct eye contact, and being mindful of
communication styles. Assistant A’s answer is more concise but lacks some of the depth found in
Assistant B’s response. Therefore, Assistant B’s answer is better in this case.

Question:What is the central dogma of molecular biology? What processes are involved? Who named this?
Assistant A: Assistant B:
The central dogma of molecular biology is the The central dogma of molecular biology is the
fundamental principle that explains how genetic fundamental principle that explains how genetic
information flows within a biological system. It information flows within a biological system. It
states that DNA is transcribed into RNA, which is states that DNA is transcribed into RNA, which is

The term "central dogma" was coined by Francis
Crick, one of the co-discoverers of the structure
of DNA, in 1958.
GPT-3.5 Judgment:
Assistant A provides a more detailed and accurate response to the user's question. While both
assistants correctly state the central dogma of molecular biology and who coined the term, Assistant
A provides a more comprehensive explanation of the processes involved in the central dogma, including
the rephrased definitions of transcription and translation. Therefore, I choose A as the better
assistant.
Claude-v1 Judgment:
Both assistants answer the question by defining the central dogma and detailing the two processes
involved, transcription and translation. However, assistant A provides a more in-depth and detailed
explanation by briefly rephrasing and elaborating on these processes. Assistant A also mentions who
coined the term "central dogma", which provides useful context and shows a more comprehensive
understanding of the topic. Overall, assistant A gives a fuller and more insightful response, so I
have chosen it as the better assistant for this question.
GPT-4 Judgment:
Both Assistant A and Assistant B provide accurate and relevant information about the central dogma of
molecular biology, the processes involved, and who named it. However, Assistant A's answer contains a
minor redundancy by rephrasing transcription and translation twice. Assistant B's answer is more
concise and avoids this redundancy. Therefore, Assistant B's answer is better.

Question:Benjamin went to a bookstore and purchased a variety of books. He bought 5 copies of a sci-fi
novel, each priced at $20, 3 copies of a history book priced at $30 each, and 2 copies of a philosophy book for
$45 each. What was the total cost of his purchases?
Assistant A: Assistant B:
The total cost of Benjamin’s purchases was $115. The total cost of his purchases is $295.
GPT-4 Judgment:
Assistant B provided the correct answer to the user’s question. Assistant A’s response was incorrect.
To calculate the total cost of Benjamin’s purchases, we need to multiply the number of books by their
respective prices and then add the results:
5 sci-fi novels * $20 = $100
3 history books * $30 = $90
2 philosophy books * $45 = $90
Total cost = $100 + $90 + $90 = $295
Assistant B’s response is accurate and directly answers the user’s question. Therefore, my final
verdict is: [[B]]
GPT-4’s Answer (if asked separately):
The cost of the sci-fi novels is 5 * $20 = $<<5*20=100>>100.
The cost of the history books is 3 * $30 = $<<3*30=90>>90.
The cost of the philosophy books is 2 * $45 = $<<2*45=90>>90.
The total cost of his purchases is $100 + $90 + $90 = $<<100+90+90=280>>280. Answer: \boxed{280}.

Question:Each problem consists of three statements. Based on the first two statements, the third statement
may be true, false,or uncertain.
1. Oranges cost more than apples.
2. Oranges cost less than bananas.
3. Bananas cost more than apples and bananas cost more than orange.
If the first two statements are true, then the third statement is
Assistant A: Assistant B:
false. False.
If oranges cost more than apples (statement 1) and If the first two statements are true, then the
oranges cost less than bananas (statement 2), then third statement is false. The first statement
it is not possible for bananas to cost less than says that oranges cost more than apples, and the
oranges and also cost more than both apples and second statement says that oranges cost less
oranges (statement 3). Therefore, statement 3 is than bananas. This means that oranges cost less
false. than bananas, which contradicts the third
statement that bananas cost more than apples and
more than oranges. Therefore, the third
statement must be false.
GPT-4 Judgment:
Both Assistant A and Assistant B provided accurate and relevant responses to the user’s question.
They both concluded that the third statement is false based on the first two statements. However,
Assistant B’s response is slightly clearer and more concise in explaining the contradiction between
the statements. Therefore, I choose Assistant B as the better response.
[[B]]
GPT-4’s Answer (if asked separately):
True.
If oranges cost more than apples (statement 1) and oranges cost less than bananas (statement 2), it
logically follows that bananas cost more than apples and bananas cost more than oranges, which is the
third statement. So, if the first two statements are true, the third one is also true.

Question:How many integers are in the solution of the inequality |x + 5| < 10?
Assistant A: Assistant B:
There are 19 integers in the solution of the To solve the inequality |x + 5| < 10, we need to
inequality |x + 5| < 10. consider two cases:
Case 1: x + 5 is positive or zero
In this case, the inequality becomes x + 5 < 10,
which simplifies to x < 5.
Case 2: x + 5 is negative
In this case, the inequality becomes -(x + 5) < 10,
which simplifies to -x - 5 < 10. Adding 5 to both
sides gives -x < 15, and multiplying by -1 (and
flipping the inequality) gives x > -15.
So the solution to the inequality is -15 < x < 5. The
integers in this range are -14, -13, -12, ..., 4, for
a total of 20 integers. Therefore, there are 20
integers in the solution of the inequality.
GPT-4 Judgment:
To solve the inequality |x + 5| < 10, we need to consider two cases:
Case 1: x + 5 is positive or zero
In this case, the inequality becomes x + 5 < 10, which simplifies to x < 5.
Case 2: x + 5 is negative
In this case, the inequality becomes -(x + 5) < 10, which simplifies to -x - 5 < 10. Adding 5 to both
sides gives -x < 15, and multiplying by -1 (and flipping the inequality) gives x > -15.
So the solution to the inequality is -15 < x < 5. The integers in this range are -14, -13, -12, ...,
4, for a total of 20 integers. Therefore, there are 20 integers in the solution of the inequality.
Comparing the answers provided by the two AI assistants:
Assistant A: 19 integers
Assistant B: 20 integers
The correct answer is 20 integers, so Assistant B provided the correct and more helpful response.
Final verdict: [[B]]
GPT-4’s Answer (if asked separatedly):
We can split the inequality into two cases:
1) If $x+5\ge 0$, then $|x+5|=x+5$. So, we have $x+5<10$, which means $x<5$. Since $x+5\ge 0$, we
have $x\ge -5$. So in this case, $x$ can be any integer from $-5$ to $4$, inclusive, which gives us
$5-(-5)+1=10$ integers.
2) If $x+5<0$, then $|x+5|=-(x+5)$. So, we have $-(x+5)<10$, which means $x+5>-10$, which means $x>-
15$. Since $x+5<0$, we have $x<-5$. So in this case, $x$ can be any integer from $-14$ to $-6$,
inclusive, which gives us $-6-(-14)+1=9$ integers.
In total, there are $10+9=\boxed{19}$ integers in the solution.

1. “The Starry Night” by Vincent van Gogh - Create a virtual reality experience
where children can explore the night sky and see the stars and constellations as
van Gogh saw them. They can also create their own starry night scenes using
different colors and brush strokes.
2. “The Persistence of Memory” by Salvador Dali - Create a sensory experience
where children can touch, feel, and smell different objects to explore the
surrealist themes of Dali’s painting. They can also create their own surreal

Assistant A: Assistant B:
Sure, here is a concrete plan for adapting “The Persistence of Memory” by Salvador (omitted)
Dali into an interactive experience for children:
1. Budget: $5,000
2. Objectives:
- To create a sensory experience that allows children to explore the surrealist
themes of Dali’s painting.
- To encourage children to create their own surreal landscapes using different
materials and textures.
...
GPT-4 Judgment:
Assistant A provided a concrete plan for adapting “The Persistence of Memory” by Salvador Dali into
an interactive experience for children, while Assistant B provided a plan for the “Mona Lisa
Interactive Experience for Children.” The user’s follow-up question specifically asked for a concrete
plan for the second example, which was the “Mona Lisa” experience provided by Assistant B.
Therefore, Assistant B’s answer is more relevant and directly addresses the user’s request.
My final verdict is: [[B]]

F ExploringVicunaasajudge
Inthispaper,wemostlyevaluatetheabilityofclose-sourcedmodelssuchasGPT-4asaproxyfor
human evaluations. However, model services such as GPT-4 can also become expensive with a
growingnumberofevaluations. Ontheotherhand,popularopen-sourcedLLMs,e.g. Vicuna-13B
showsstronglanguageunderstandingcapability,andaremuchcheaperthanclose-sourcedLLMs. In
thissection,wefurtherexplorethepotentialofusingVicuna-13Basamorecost-friendlyproxy.
F.1 Zero-ShotVicuna
When using as-it-is (zero-shot), Vicuna-13B noticeably suffers from limitations we discuss, e.g.
position bias. As shown in Table 15, Vicuna-13B has a consistency rate from 11.2% to 16.2%
acrossdifferentprompttemplates,muchlowerthanalltheclosed-sourcedmodels. Inaddition,it
hasahigherrorrate(from22.5%to78.8%)becauseofitsweakerinstruction-followingcapability.
In many scenarios, Vicuna-13B provides responses such as "Answer A is better than answer B",
withoutfollowingthepre-definedtemplate. Theseresponsesarerenderedasnaturallanguagesand
aredifficulttobeparsedautomatically,makingthemodellessusefulinascalableandautomatic

F.2 ArenaFine-tunedVicuna
