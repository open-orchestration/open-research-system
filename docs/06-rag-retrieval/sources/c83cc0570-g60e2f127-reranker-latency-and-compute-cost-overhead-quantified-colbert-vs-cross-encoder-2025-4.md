# Reranking for RAG: +40% Accuracy with Cross-Encoders (2025 Guide)
February 10, 2025
11 min read
Ailog Research Team
Boost RAG accuracy by 40% using reranking. Complete guide to cross-encoders, Cohere Rerank API, and ColBERT for production retrieval systems.
## TL;DR
  * **Reranking** = Second-pass scoring of retrieved docs for better precision
  * **Cross-encoders** deliver 10-25% accuracy improvement over pure retrieval
  * **Cohere Rerank API** : Easiest option ($1/1000 queries)
  * **Self-hosted** : ms-marco cross-encoders (free, good quality)
  * **[Compare rerankers](https://app.ailog.fr/chat)** on your data with Ailog


## The Reranking Problem
Initial retrieval (vector search, BM25) casts a wide net to recall potentially relevant documents. However:
  * **False positives** : Some retrieved chunks aren't actually relevant
  * **Ranking quality** : Most relevant chunks may not be ranked first
  * **Query-specific relevance** : Initial ranking doesn't account for query nuances


**Solution** : Rerank retrieved candidates with a more sophisticated model.
## Two-Stage Retrieval

```
Query → [Stage 1: Retrieval] → 100 candidates
       → [Stage 2: Reranking] → 10 best results
       → [Stage 3: Generation] → Answer

```

**Why two stages?**
  * Retrieval: Fast, scales to millions/billions of documents
  * Reranking: Expensive but accurate, only on small candidate set
  * Best of both: Speed + Quality


## Reranking Approaches
### Cross-Encoder Models
Unlike bi-encoders (embed query and document separately), cross-encoders process query and document together.
**Bi-encoder (Retrieval)**

```




DEVELOPERpython



query_emb = embed(query)           # [768]
doc_emb = embed(document)          # [768]
score = cosine(query_emb, doc_emb)  # Similarity



```

**Cross-encoder (Reranking)**

```




DEVELOPERpython



# Process together
input = f"[CLS] {query} [SEP] {document} [SEP]"
score = model(input)  # Direct relevance score



```

**Why cross-encoders are better:**
  * Attention between query and document tokens
  * Captures word-level interactions
  * More accurate relevance scoring


**Why not use for retrieval:**
  * Must score each query-document pair (O(n))
  * Too slow for large collections
  * No pre-computed embeddings


### Popular Cross-Encoder Models
**ms-marco-MiniLM-L6-v2**

```




DEVELOPERpython



from sentence_transformers import CrossEncoder

model = CrossEncoder('cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L6-v2')

# Score query-document pairs
scores = model.predict([
    (query, doc1),
    (query, doc2),
    (query, doc3)
])

# Rerank by score
ranked_indices = np.argsort(scores)[::-1]



```

**Characteristics:**
  * Size: 80MB
  * Speed: ~50ms per batch
  * Quality: Good for English
  * Training: Trained on MS MARCO


**ms-marco-TinyBERT-L2-v2**
  * Even smaller/faster
  * Slight quality tradeoff
  * Good for latency-critical apps


**mmarco-mMiniLMv2-L12-H384-v1**
  * Multilingual support
  * Similar performance to English models
  * Supports 100+ languages


### Implementation

```




DEVELOPERpython



class RerankedRetriever:
    def __init__(self, base_retriever, reranker_model):
        self.retriever = base_retriever
        self.reranker = CrossEncoder(reranker_model)

    def retrieve(self, query, k=5, rerank_top_n=20):
        # Stage 1: Retrieve more candidates
        candidates = self.retriever.retrieve(query, k=rerank_top_n)

        # Stage 2: Rerank
        pairs = [(query, doc['content']) for doc in candidates]
        scores = self.reranker.predict(pairs)

        # Sort by reranker scores
        ranked_indices = np.argsort(scores)[::-1]
        reranked_docs = [candidates[i] for i in ranked_indices]

        # Return top-k
        return reranked_docs[:k]



```

## LLM-Based Reranking
Use an LLM to judge relevance.
### Binary Relevance
Ask LLM if document is relevant.

```




DEVELOPERpython



def llm_rerank_binary(query, documents, llm):
    relevant_docs = []

    for doc in documents:
        prompt = f"""Is this document relevant to the query?

Query: {query}

Document: {doc}

Answer only 'yes' or 'no'."""

        response = llm.generate(prompt, max_tokens=5)

        if 'yes' in response.lower():
            relevant_docs.append(doc)

    return relevant_docs



```

### Scoring Relevance
Get numerical relevance scores.

```




DEVELOPERpython



def llm_rerank_score(query, documents, llm):
    scored_docs = []

    for doc in documents:
        prompt = f"""Rate the relevance of this document to the query on a scale of 1-10.

Query: {query}

Document: {doc}

Relevance score (1-10):"""

        score = int(llm.generate(prompt, max_tokens=5))
        scored_docs.append((doc, score))

    # Sort by score
    scored_docs.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    return [doc for doc, score in scored_docs]



```

### Comparative Ranking
Compare documents pairwise or in batches.

```




DEVELOPERpython



def llm_rerank_comparative(query, documents, llm):
    prompt = f"""Rank these documents by relevance to the query.

Query: {query}

Documents:
{format_documents(documents)}

Provide ranking (most to least relevant):"""

    ranking = llm.generate(prompt)
    ranked_docs = parse_ranking(ranking, documents)

    return ranked_docs



```

**Pros:**
  * Very accurate
  * Can handle nuanced relevance
  * Explains reasoning


**Cons:**
  * Expensive (LLM call per document or batch)
  * Slow (hundreds of ms to seconds)
  * May exceed context window with many docs


**Use when:**
  * Highest quality required
  * Cost/latency acceptable
  * Small candidate set (< 10 docs)


## Cohere Rerank API
Managed reranking service.

```




DEVELOPERpython



import cohere

co = cohere.Client(api_key="your-key")

def cohere_rerank(query, documents, top_n=5):
    response = co.rerank(
        query=query,
        documents=documents,
        top_n=top_n,
        model="rerank-english-v2.0"
    )

    return [doc.document for doc in response.results]



```

**Models:**
  * `rerank-english-v2.0`: English
  * `rerank-multilingual-v2.0`: 100+ languages


**Pricing:**
  * $1.00 per 1000 searches (as of 2025)


**Pros:**
  * Managed service
  * High quality
  * Multilingual


**Cons:**
  * API latency
  * Ongoing cost
  * Vendor dependency


## FlashRank
Efficient local reranking.

```




DEVELOPERpython



from flashrank import Ranker, RerankRequest

ranker = Ranker(model_name="ms-marco-MultiBERT-L-12")

def flashrank_rerank(query, documents, top_n=5):
    rerank_request = RerankRequest(
        query=query,
        passages=[{"text": doc} for doc in documents]
    )

    results = ranker.rerank(rerank_request)

    return [r.text for r in results[:top_n]]



```

**Benefits:**
  * Very fast (optimized inference)
  * Self-hosted
  * No API costs


## Hybrid Reranking
Combine multiple signals.

```




DEVELOPERpython



def hybrid_rerank(query, documents, weights=None):
    if weights is None:
        weights = {
            'vector_score': 0.3,
            'bm25_score': 0.2,
            'cross_encoder': 0.5
        }

    # Get scores from different models
    vector_scores = get_vector_scores(query, documents)
    bm25_scores = get_bm25_scores(query, documents)
    ce_scores = get_cross_encoder_scores(query, documents)

    # Normalize scores to [0, 1]
    vector_scores = normalize(vector_scores)
    bm25_scores = normalize(bm25_scores)
    ce_scores = normalize(ce_scores)

    # Weighted combination
    final_scores = (
        weights['vector_score'] * vector_scores +
        weights['bm25_score'] * bm25_scores +
        weights['cross_encoder'] * ce_scores
    )

    # Rank documents
    ranked_indices = np.argsort(final_scores)[::-1]
    return [documents[i] for i in ranked_indices]



```

## Reranking Strategies
### Top-K Reranking
Rerank only top candidates from initial retrieval.

```




DEVELOPERpython



# Retrieve top 20, rerank to get top 5
candidates = retriever.retrieve(query, k=20)
reranked = reranker.rerank(query, candidates, top_n=5)



```

**Settings:**
  * Retrieve: 3-5x the final k
  * Rerank: Final k needed


**Example:**
  * Need 5 final results
  * Retrieve 20 candidates
  * Rerank to top 5


### Cascading Reranking
Multiple reranking stages with increasing accuracy.

```




DEVELOPERpython



# Stage 1: Fast retrieval
candidates = fast_retriever.retrieve(query, k=100)

# Stage 2: Fast reranker
reranked_1 = tiny_reranker.rerank(query, candidates, top_n=20)

# Stage 3: Accurate reranker
reranked_2 = large_reranker.rerank(query, reranked_1, top_n=5)

return reranked_2



```

**Use when:**
  * Very large candidate sets
  * Multiple quality tiers needed
  * Optimizing cost/latency


### Query-Adaptive Reranking
Different reranking based on query type.

```




DEVELOPERpython



def adaptive_rerank(query, documents):
    query_type = classify_query(query)

    if query_type == "factual":
        # Use keyword signals
        return bm25_rerank(query, documents)

    elif query_type == "semantic":
        # Use cross-encoder
        return cross_encoder_rerank(query, documents)

    elif query_type == "complex":
        # Use LLM
        return llm_rerank(query, documents)



```

## Performance Optimization
### Batching
Rerank multiple queries efficiently.

```




DEVELOPERpython



# Bad: One at a time
for query in queries:
    rerank(query, docs)

# Good: Batched
pairs = [(q, doc) for q in queries for doc in docs]
scores = reranker.predict(pairs, batch_size=32)



```

### Caching
Cache reranking results.

```




DEVELOPERpython



from functools import lru_cache
import hashlib

def cache_key(query, doc):
    return hashlib.md5(f"{query}:{doc}".encode()).hexdigest()

@lru_cache(maxsize=10000)
def cached_rerank_score(query, doc):
    return reranker.predict([(query, doc)])[0]



```

### Async Reranking
Parallelize reranking calls.

```




DEVELOPERpython



import asyncio

async def async_rerank_batch(query, documents):
    tasks = [
        rerank_async(query, doc)
        for doc in documents
    ]
    scores = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    return rank_by_scores(documents, scores)



```

## Evaluation
### Metrics
**Precision@k** : Relevant docs in top-k after reranking

```




DEVELOPERpython



def precision_at_k(reranked_docs, relevant_docs, k):
    top_k = set(reranked_docs[:k])
    relevant = set(relevant_docs)
    return len(top_k & relevant) / k



```

**NDCG@k** : Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain

```




DEVELOPERpython



from sklearn.metrics import ndcg_score

def evaluate_reranking(predictions, relevance_labels, k=5):
    return ndcg_score([relevance_labels], [predictions], k=k)



```

**MRR** : Mean Reciprocal Rank

```




DEVELOPERpython



def mrr(reranked_docs, relevant_docs):
    for i, doc in enumerate(reranked_docs, 1):
        if doc in relevant_docs:
            return 1 / i
    return 0



```

### A/B Testing
Compare reranking strategies.

```




DEVELOPERpython



# Control: No reranking
control_results = retriever.retrieve(query, k=5)

# Treatment: With reranking
treatment_candidates = retriever.retrieve(query, k=20)
treatment_results = reranker.rerank(query, treatment_candidates, k=5)

# Measure: User satisfaction, answer quality



```

## Cost-Benefit Analysis  
| Reranker  | Latency  | Cost/1K  | Quality  | Best For  |  
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |  
| No reranking  | 0ms  | $0  | Baseline  | Budget/speed critical  |  
| TinyBERT  | +30ms  | $0 (self-hosted)  | +10%  | Balanced  |  
| MiniLM  | +50ms  | $0 (self-hosted)  | +20%  | Quality-focused  |  
| Cohere  | +100ms  | $1  | +25%  | Managed simplicity  |  
| LLM  | +500ms  | $5-20  | +30%  | Highest quality  |  
## Best Practices
  1. **Always overfetch for reranking** : Retrieve 3-5x the final k
  2. **Start with cross-encoder** : MiniLM is a good default
  3. **Measure impact** : A/B test reranking vs. no reranking
  4. **Tune retrieval count** : Balance cost and recall
  5. **Consider query latency budget** : Reranking adds 50-500ms
  6. **Monitor costs** : LLM reranking can be expensive at scale


## Choosing a Reranker
**Prototyping:**
  * cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L6-v2
  * Easy to use, good quality


**Production (Cost-Sensitive):**
  * cross-encoder/ms-marco-TinyBERT-L2-v2
  * Self-hosted, fast


**Production (Quality-Focused):**
  * Cohere Rerank API
  * Highest quality, managed


**Multilingual:**
  * mmarco-mMiniLMv2-L12-H384-v1
  * cross-encoder/mmarco-mMiniLMv2-L12


**Highest Quality (Budget Available):**
  * LLM-based reranking
  * GPT-4, Claude for best results


> **💡 Expert Tip from Ailog** : **Reranking is high impact but not first priority.** Get your chunking, embeddings, and retrieval right first – they're foundational. Once you have a working RAG system, reranking is the easiest way to gain another 10-25% accuracy. Start with Cohere Rerank API for zero-setup wins. We added reranking to production in one afternoon and immediately saw fewer hallucinations and better answer quality.

## FAQ
### What is the difference between reranking and vector search?
Vector search (retrieval) compares embeddings to quickly find candidate documents among millions. Reranking comes after: it takes those candidates (typically 20-100) and re-scores them with a more accurate model (cross-encoder) that analyzes each query-document pair in depth. Vector search prioritizes speed, reranking prioritizes precision.
### Does reranking slow down RAG responses?
Yes, reranking typically adds 50 to 500ms of latency depending on the model and number of documents. A lightweight cross-encoder like TinyBERT adds ~50ms for 20 documents. Cohere Rerank adds ~200ms (including API call). LLM-based reranking (GPT-4, Claude) can add 1-3 seconds. For most RAG applications, the quality gain far outweighs this delay.
### Which reranker should I use for multilingual content?
For multilingual projects, use a model trained on multilingual data like `cross-encoder/mmarco-mMiniLMv2-L12` (open source) or the Cohere Rerank API which natively supports 100+ languages. Avoid models trained exclusively on English MS MARCO data: they lose quality on non-English content. The mMARCO models were specifically trained on multilingual data.
### Is reranking essential for a RAG system?
No, but it's highly recommended. A good RAG pipeline without reranking can work correctly if chunking and embeddings are well-calibrated. Reranking typically brings 10-25% additional precision and reduces hallucinations. It's the optimization with the best effort-to-impact ratio once the foundations are in place.
### How much does reranking cost in production?
Self-hosted cross-encoders are free (excluding GPU compute). Cohere Rerank costs approximately $1 per 1,000 reranking requests. LLM-based reranking costs significantly more (input tokens × number of documents). For most projects, Cohere Rerank or a self-hosted cross-encoder offer the best value for money.
## Next Steps
With retrieval and reranking optimized, it's critical to measure performance. The next guide covers evaluation metrics and methodologies for assessing RAG system quality.
